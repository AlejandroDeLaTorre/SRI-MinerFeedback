SRI miner feedback

We need your feedback, dear miners!

The new StratumV2 (SRI) update, allows miners to select transactions via a new sub-protocol and their node. This is a major milestone in democratizing transaction selections in pooled mining and decentralizing bitcoin!

We’re inviting bitcoin miners to pilot test the software locally with their mining devices. Your feedback will have a high impact on the development direction. If you have any of these devices listed in the chart below please reach out through our google form doc here.

SRI’s flexible stack offers various components to choose from when setting up a configuration that suits your needs. We need feedback on testing the SV1 mining device (Antminer S9, S19+, or Whatsminer), connecting to an SV2 pool via Translation Proxy. Miners will be running their own template provider (bitcoind) with the max fee policy. Within the translation proxy, sits a Job Negotiator which runs sub-protocol responsible for distributing miner’s templates to the pool. 

Testing this specific setup will provide valuable feedback for the SRI development team thus improving bitcoin mining for everyone.
